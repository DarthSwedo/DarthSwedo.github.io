			<h1>About Amsterdam</h1>
			<p>From its earliest days, Amsterdam has been a bustling hub
			of commerce that welcomed other cultures with open arms. 
			Learn more about this lovely canal-side city, including the rich 
			history and development of its tolerant society. Or jump straight 
			to the modern day and find out about the city’s architecture and 
			its colourful neighbourhoods. If you’re feeling ambitious,

		<section class="Anne">
			<h1>Anne Frank Huis</h1>
			<p>Located at Prinsengracht 263, the Anne Frank Huis is where
			Anne Frank lived in hiding with her family for more than two years.
			The attic rooms are empty, but still exude the atmosphere of the 
			hiding period. Some personal items remain, like the pictures of 
			movie stars that Anne pasted to a wall, a section of wallpaper 
			where Anne’s father marked the height of his growing daughters, 
			and a map on which he recorded the advance of the Allied Forces. 
			The museum also features a refelective exhibition about the 
			persecution of the Jews and discrimination in general.</p>

		<section class="Coffeeshops">
			<h1>Coffeeshops in Amsterdam</h1>
			<p>In Amsterdam, smoking cannabis or hashish is permitted 
			in the city's coffeeshops. Visitors should keep in mind that 
			other establishments generally do not allow the consumption 
			of soft drugs on their premises.
			Coffeeshops are permitted to sell a maximum of five grammes to 
			each patron and the possession of this, although technically 
			against the law, is tolerated by the authorities. Coffeeshops are 
			taxed and strictly regulated. You must be 18 years of age to enter 
			a coffeeshop.
			Tourists are still allowed to use coffeeshops in Amsterdam.</p>
